# Robot_Head_Movement
To make a robot's head move in Cinema 4D, you can use a motor to control the movement of a joint. To move the head from right to left, you can keyframe the Angular Target Speed to positive and negative values. To move the head up and down, you can repeat the same process for a joint positioned at the base and bind it to the head mesh. With the motor attached to the joint, adjust its rotation and connect the joint to the motor. Set the Angular Target Speed to 0 to make the motor stop moving, and adjust the values to make the head move in the desired direction. It's important to experiment with the settings to achieve the desired result for your specific robot model and animation requirements.
